"""JWT verification key material.

This service verifies, but never issues, tokens -- authentication and
signing are ``services/authentication-service``'s job. RSA public keys
are, by design, safe to duplicate across services; a real deployment
mounts the same public key file authentication-service's private key
pairs with. There is nothing to *generate* here -- this service holds
no private key, so a missing file is a real configuration error, not
something to paper over with an ephemeral fallback.
